description: Template for a chunk's rubric.md — what the reviewer grades against
---

<!-- The reviewer reads this. The implementer never does, and plan.md must not
     reference it. Separate documents prevent teaching to the test.
     Items state the RULE being verified, not an example copied from the plan. -->

# Chunk <NN> — <Title> — Review Rubric

Grade each item PASS, FAIL, or N/A with the reason. A FAIL needs the evidence that
produced it: the file, the line, and what's wrong.

Items carrying a `.claude/resources/bibles/…` path cite the rule they check. **Open the
page before grading that item** — a cited rule graded from memory fails correct work as
often as it passes a violation.

## Universal Checks

- [ ] The change does what the acceptance criteria say, verified by reading the code — not
      by trusting the report
- [ ] Every verification gate was run **after the last edit**, and each one can actually
      fail (a gate that passes on the base tree proves nothing)
- [ ] New behavior has tests covering the happy path, the error path, and the edges
- [ ] `completion-report.md` exists and is committed — without it the evidence below
      cannot be graded
- [ ] The tests were observed failing before the implementation existed, and the report
      shows the red run — not just the green one
- [ ] Any abstraction introduced is justified in the plan's Design Decisions; no layer,
      base class, or indirection appears that the chunk didn't need
- [ ] No principle in `.claude/resources/project.md` is violated without a recorded
      justification
- [ ] No unrelated files touched; no scope beyond the chunk
- [ ] No secrets, credentials, or keys in the diff
- [ ] No silent failures — errors surface with context rather than being swallowed
- [ ] No duplicated logic that an existing helper already covers
- [ ] Error and warning counts are graded against the captured baseline, not absolutely
- [ ] Comments and docs the change touches are still true after it

## Test Coverage Checks

<!-- One item per file gaining new behavior, naming the file and the functions.
     If the chunk adds no testable behavior, write: N/A — no testable behavior added. -->

- [ ] <specific tests for specific new functions>

## Chunk-Specific Checks

<!-- Derived from the acceptance criteria — one checkable item each. -->

- [ ] <item>

## Verdict

**PASS** or **FAIL**, then:

- **Issues** — blocking problems, each with file, line, and what's wrong
- **Warnings** — non-blocking, worth fixing
- **Guidance** — what the next iteration should do first

Return this verdict as your final response text. Anything that must survive the review
goes in a file in the chunk directory — a message is not an artifact.
